# RESTful-API

 Building a RESTful API with Flask : Error Handling, Authentication, and File Handling with Public and Admin Routes

## Introduction:
In this mid-project, you will be building a RESTful API using Flask that covers
error handling, authentication, and file handling. The API will have two types of
routes â€“ public routes that can be accessed without authentication and
protected admin routes that require authentication. The purpose of this mid-
project is to help you understand how to build a robust API that can handle
errors, authenticate users, and handle file uploads.
